# Triangle Time

##Overview
Triangle Time is a website that allows its users to pick a website template, and then customize it. Users can add a variety of HTML elements and customize the site to their liking. When they are done, the user can save their site to their account and publish it to a subdomain of our site. Of course, if they ever change their mind, they can always delete it. Users can also view the published sites of other users for inspiration. It functions much like Squarespace, but much cooler and better.
