# Triangle Time

##Overview
Triangle Time is a website that allows its users to pick a website template, and then customize it. Users can add a variety of HTML elements and customize the site to their liking. When they are done, the user can save their site to their account and publish it to a subdomain of our site. It functions much like Squarespace, but much cooler and better.
